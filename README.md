# DSI Industrial Attachment individual project-set1 (Shop ledger)

It is a console program based on OOP concept. Here I've built a shop ledger which contains the fowllowing 6 
features.
1. **Add a product**<br />
Its basically adding a product in the inventory list with some product info (product name, buy price, sell price, available no., profit from selling the product etc.)

2. **Delete a product**<br />
  When a product is deleted, it will not show in the list but
the profit made from the product will still be there in the
available balance.

3. **Buy a product**<br />
when a product bought (listed in the inventory) the available quantity will increase and total buy price of the products get
subtracted from the available balance.

4. **Sell a product**<br />
when a product sold, profit from the product will be added to the available balance and available
quantity will get subtracted.

5. **See the list of products**<br />
Showing the  current inventoy summary (product name, available amount, profit made from individual product including deleted products) in a tabular form. 

6. **See available balance**<br />
Showing the current available balance.

### File is used to save data. So that no previous data gets deleted after terminating the program.
